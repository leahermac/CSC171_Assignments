%% Four friends were competing in the internationally renowned bog snorkeling competition.
%% As usual, the judges were a little careless and once again, they managed to loose the results.
%% Luckily, a number of spectators were able to remember the following snippets of information:

%% Only one person wore the same number as the position they finished.
%% Gary, who didnt wear green, beat Barry.
%% Larry beat the person who wore yellow.
%% The person who wore number 3, wore green.
%% The person who wore number 2 finished first whereas Harry came last.
%% The person who finished second wore green, Barry wore yellow and the person wearing red beat the person wearing blue.

%% Can you work out who finished where, the number and color they wore?

%% Answer: 
%% 1 Gary 2 red
%% 2 Larry 3 green
%% 3 Barry 1 yellow
%% 4 Harry 4 blue
